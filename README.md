# css-schema
JSON Schema of the Entire CSS Specification

Open, Free and brought to you by the good people at [RCorp](http://wwww.rcorp.co.in).

## Introduction

### What is this?
There is no real specification of all possible CSS properties and all possible CSS values in a machine readable form. We found [JSONSchema](http://json-schema.org/) to be the best standard to specify all these CSS Properties and values.

### How is this useful?
Off the top of our heads? You could make validators, parsers, learning tools, IDE plugins, autocompletes, Drag n Drop tools, manuals etc etc.!
